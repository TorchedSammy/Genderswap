This is a very simple Content Patcher mod for Stardew Valley which
has some of the male cast of characters turned into girls!

This is a port of [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/474)
to use Content Patcher. Everything is done by them, I just wrote some JSON.

# Install

I'm not really sure how to license this, considering I'm hosting
art which isn't mine, so it'll stay without license.
